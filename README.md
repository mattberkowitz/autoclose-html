# Auto Close HTML package for Atom Text Editor

Will automatically add closing tags when you complete the opening tag.
Updated to correct extra indentation of closing tags on block elements.

# Installation

Install using

`apm install autoclose-html`

Until merge of this fork, install using temporary installation process as follows:

1. Uninstall autoclose-html 0.24.0
2. open a terminal and ...
3. > cd ~/.atom/packages
4. > git clone https://github.com/Ordinal-Data-Inc/autoclose-html.git
5. > cd autoclose-html
6. > npm install
7. > restart Atom
8. Check that Atom > preferences > packages shows autoclose-html 0.24.1
9. (Optional) Have a sip of coffee   

# Usage

Under normal circumstances ending tags will be inserted on the same line for inline elements and with `\n\t\n` in between for block elements. This is determined by attaching an element of the given type to the window and checking it's calculated `display` value.
You can use Force Inline and Force Block preferences to override this.

# Bug Reports and Contributing

If you find a bug, please feel free to file an issue. Please understand however that I have very little time to work on this anymore, so most feature requests will not be implemented.

Better than an issue, however, would be to try and fix it yourself and submit a PR.

If you are interested in helping maintain this library, please contact me. As I mentioned, I have very little time to devote to this anymore, so if someone has interest in helping to keep it maintained, I'm open to considering it.


# Options

## Force Inline

Elements in this comma delimited list will render their closing tags on the same line, even if they are block by default. You can set this to "*" to force all closing tags to render inline.

## Force Block

Elements in this comma delimited list will render their closing tags after a tabbed line, even if they are inline by default. A value of "*" for Force Inline overrides all values in Force Block.

## Never Close

Elements in this comma delimited list should *not* render a closing tag

## Make Never Close Elements Self Closing

Will convert elements in Never Close list from `<br>` to `<br />`

## Legacy/International Mode

Enables the old style of completion detection using buffer events rather than keybindings.
Atom doesn't work well currently with non-US/non-QUERTY keyboards and will not correctly
fire events when '>' is pressed and/or fire events for entirely different keys.  **Please note that
this mode is buggy (ie can complete after undo) and may not be compatible with new
features and bug fixes in future releases, post-0.22.0** If/when the core issues behind
keybindings not reporting correctly on international keyboards is solved this option will
be removed.
